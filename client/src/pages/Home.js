                When you’re searching for colleges, try to remember what college should be. It's a place where:

                <br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>You're comfortable being yourself—but also challenged to be better.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>You have opportunities to study things that fascinate you, play the sports you want to play, work at internships that help clarify your career plans.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>You learn how to learn, communicate well, and solve problems — skills all employers want to see, no matter what industry.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>And you can get this kind of education without breaking the bank and taking on crazy amounts of student debt.</li>
